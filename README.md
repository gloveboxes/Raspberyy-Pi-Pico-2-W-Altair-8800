# Raspberry Pi Pico Altair 8800

## Project Heritage

This project is a microcontroller implementation of the [Altair 8800 Emulator on Embedded Linux](https://github.com/gloveboxes/Altair-8800-Emulator).

## Clone With Submodules

This project bundles Pimoroni's Pico helper libraries as a git submodule.
Clone (or update) with:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gloveboxes/pico-altair-8800.git
```

## Serial Terminal

### macos

1. screen /dev/tty.usbmodem101 115200
   
   - screen is built into macOS
   - Exit: Press <kbd>ctrl+c</kbd> then <kbd>K</kbd>

2. picocom /dev/tty.usbmodem101 -b 115200

    - Install

        ```shell
        brew install picocom
        ```

    - Exit: Press <kbd>ctrl+a</kbd>, then <kbd>ctrl+x</kbd>


## Wi-Fi Console

For WiFi-enabled boards (Pico W, Pico 2 W):

1. WiFi credentials are configured at runtime via a serial terminal app (see WIFI_CONFIG_README.md for details)
   - Connect using `picocom /dev/tty.usbmodem101 -b 115200` or `screen /dev/tty.usbmodem101 115200`
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to configure WiFi SSID and password
2. On boot the Pico W connects to Wi-Fi and starts a WebSocket console on port `8088`
3. Point a browser at `http://<pico-ip>:8088/` to load the bundled console UI, or use any WebSocket-capable client (e.g., `wscat`) to connect to `ws://<pico-ip>:8088/` and interact with the Altair terminal alongside USB serial

## Selecting a Target Board

`PICO_BOARD` now defaults to `pico2_w` (RP2350 Pico 2 W). Override it when configuring to target the non-W version or other boards:

```shell
cmake -B build -DPICO_BOARD=pico2 [...other flags...]
```

- Non-W boards (e.g., `pico2`) do not have a CYW43 radio, so leave `-DALTAIR_ENABLE_WEBSOCKET=OFF` for a USB-only firmware.
- The RP2040-based Pico (original) still builds, but its 264 KB of SRAM is very tight for the full CP/M image—expect to trim features if you go that route.

### CMake Configuration Options

| Option | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-DINKY_SUPPORT=ON` | ON | Pulls in the Pimoroni Inky Pack driver and shows the welcome/IP screen. Set to `OFF` to save flash/RAM when the display isn't connected. |
| `-DDISPLAY_2_8_SUPPORT=ON` | ON | Enables support for 2.8" display. Set to `OFF` if not using this display. |
| `-DPICO_BOARD=pico2_w` | pico2_w | Selects the Pico variant (e.g., `pico2`, `pico2_w`, `pico`, `pico_w`). WebSockets are automatically enabled for WiFi-capable boards. |
| `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` | Debug | Usual CMake switch for optimized builds (recommended). |

## Regenerate Disk Image Header

1. Copy the .dsk file to the disks folder
2. Run the following command

    ```shell
    python3 dsk_to_header.py --input cpm63k.dsk --output cpm63k_disk.h --symbol cpm63k_dsk
    ```

3. Copy the .h file to the Altair8800 folder
4. Rebuild and deploy


## Rebuild for Performance

cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release regenerated the build directory with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE explicitly set to Release (confirmed by the “Build type is Release” line). That enables the Pico SDK’s release optimization flags (-O3, no extra debug helpers).
cmake --build build then rebuilt everything with those settings. The log shows only Release-config targets being built and the final altair.elf linked successfully with no errors—just the usual picotool fetch/install noise and a warning about duplicate errors/liberrors.a, which the SDK always emits.


```shell
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

## Deploying Firmware

After building, you can use the deployment script to flash firmware to your Pico board:

```shell
cd Releases
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:
1. List all available .uf2 firmware files in alphabetical order
2. Allow you to select which firmware to deploy by entering a number
3. Automatically reboot the connected Pico into BOOTSEL mode
4. Upload and run the selected firmware
5. Return to the file list for deploying to additional boards

Press `q` to quit when finished. The script requires `picotool` to be installed (see installation instructions below).

## Building for Different Boards

WebSocket support is automatically enabled for WiFi-capable boards (`pico_w` and `pico2_w`) and disabled for non-WiFi boards (`pico` and `pico2`). You can build for specific boards using VS Code tasks:
